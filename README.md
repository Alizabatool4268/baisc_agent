## Example poem
Here is a sample poem written with its use.

Her world is painted in a softer hue,

Since love's sweet arrow found its mark so true.

A blush of crimson blooms upon her cheek,

When thoughts of him, unspoken, softly speak.


His name's a whisper on the morning breeze,
A silent secret carried through the trees.
His laughter echoes in her inner ear,
Chasing away each shadow, every fear.


Her heart, a hummingbird, takes rapid flight,
Whenever he appears within her sight.
A simple glance, a casual, passing word,
Is music to her soul, distinctly heard.


She traces patterns on a steamy pane,
Imagining his smile, again and again.
Each ordinary day now feels profound,
With his sweet memory, her world is bound.


She dreams of futures, woven, strong, and bright,
Beneath the moon, or in the warm sunlight.
Of hands entwined, of stories yet to share,
Lost in the magic of a love so rare.

For in her eyes, a tender glow resides,
A testament to where her spirit rides.
A girl in love, with wonder in her gaze,
Lost in the beauty of these sunlit days.
